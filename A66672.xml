            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>As concerning the Oath of Office, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace were at first enjoyned to take it, by the Statute of</hi> 13. R. 2.7. <hi>which Statute you may hereafter ſee in Title</hi> Juſtices of Peace, Clauſe 16. <hi>And afterwards by the Statutes of</hi> 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. 1. <hi>and</hi> 7. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. <hi>they were alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to take the Oathes of</hi> Supremacie <hi>and</hi> Obedience, <hi>which Oathes you ſhall alſo hereafter finde in Title</hi> Recuſants, 8, <hi>and</hi> 88. <hi>The Oath of</hi> Office <hi>is this that followes;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yee ſhall ſweare, That as <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> in the County of <hi>B.</hi> in all articles in the Kings Commiſſion to you directed, yee ſhall doe equall right to the poore and to the rich, after your cunning, wit, and power, and after the lawes and cuſtomes of the
<pb facs="tcp:41833:8"/>Realme, and ſtatutes thereof made: And yee ſhall not be of counſell of any quarrell hanging before you: And that yee hold your Seſſions after the forme of Statutes thereof made: And the iſſues, fines and amerciaments that ſhall happen to be made, and all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures which ſhall fall before you, yee ſhall cauſe to be entred without any concealment or imbezzelling, and truely ſend them to the <hi>Kings Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi> Yee ſhall not let, for gift or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, but well and truely you ſhall doe your Office of <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> in that behalfe: And that you take nothing for your Office of <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> to be done, but of the King, and fees accuſtomed, and coſts limited by the Statute: And yee ſhall not direct or cauſe to be directed any Warrant (by you to be made) to the parties, but ye ſhall direct them to the Bailiffes of the ſaid County, or other the Kings Officers (or miniſters) or other indifferent perſons to doe execution thereof. So help you God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, for concluſion of this Preface, I conceive it not impertinent to annex there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb facs="tcp:41833:8"/>the ſubſtance of two Statutes, neceſſary to be knowne by every Iuſtice of Peace before he enters upon his Office; the firſt is</hi> 2. H. 5. Stat. 2. Cap. 1. <hi>which provides, That</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace ſhall be made of the moſt ſufficient perſons dwelling within the Counties, by the advice of the Chancellour, and of the Kings Counſell; and that no forraine dweller ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſuch Office, except Lords, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Aſſiſe, and chiefe Stewards of the lands and Seigniories belonging to the Duchie of Lancaſter. <hi>And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their reſidence in the Country, ſee more hereafter in Title</hi> Juſtices of Peace, 20. <hi>The other Statute is</hi> 4. H. 7. cap. 12. <hi>whereby the King commandeth all Juſtices of Peace</hi> diligently to exerciſe their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; to the end, that his people by that meanes living in peace, and enjoying their owne, husbandry may flouriſh. Hee alſo chargeth all, both poore and rich, that ſhall ſuffer any grievance from others (wherein a Juſtice of Peace may intermeddle) that they forthwith make complaint thereof to the next Juſtice of Peace, and having no remedie there, to the Juſtices of
<pb facs="tcp:41833:9"/>Aſſiſe, if it be not long before their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into that Country; but if it be, then to the Chancellour for the time being, and then the King will ſend for the Juſtice ſo neglecting his duty; and in caſe he ſhall find him guilty thereof, will cauſe him to be put out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and otherwiſe puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his demerits, &amp;c.</p>
